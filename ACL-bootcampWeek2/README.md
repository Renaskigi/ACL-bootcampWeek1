# Project: About Me

## Overview
<!-- This project is designed to help incorporate concepts learned in the classroom, through reading, and through practice. The project is progressively built with layered concepts and instruction; that is, each new addition builds upon previous knowledge gained and practiced. It gives us a chance to show what we've learned and how we approach objectives. -->

## Getting Started
<!-- Learn the fundamentals of JS, HTML, and CSS as practiced in early 2018 and how to make them all work together.-->
