            <h2>Some interesting factoids about me:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I drove 300,000 miles as a trucker. As a result, I have been to every state in the continental United States.</li>
                <li>I was adopted at 10 days old, 
                making me my parents' Valentine's
                day surprise! (awwww!).</li>
                <li>I once met Gregory Hines at a hotel and got on the elevator with him. I told him he looked "a lot like that guy Gregory Hines", and he replied (with a wink and a smile), "You know, I've heard that. But, I think I look a lot better than that guy." He was a gracious celebrity - and my only contact with a famous person that I did not end up "star struck" in.</li>              
            </ul>
